=======================================

This is a module you can use to push Cuckoo's JSON report to an HPFeeds
broker.

In order to install it, follow these steps:
- Put hpfeeds.py in "lib/"
- Put hpfclient.py in "modules/reporting/"
- Append the following section to "conf/reporting.conf":

[hpfclient]

The module will be automatically executed when each analysis is completed.
